# Baby's Daybook

I created this website to learn different web technologies as well as to help my wife keep track of our baby's checkup info and find some interesting insights from data generated by an android app [Baby Daybook]. Another motivation was at the time the Baby Daybook app didn't have the ability to visualize data. Athough this feature exists now, I think we can still improve on how data is visualized and this website is a starting example.

The android app allows data to be backup to a dropbox account. This data is stored in a sqlite database file. This website uses the database file for searching and as well as data visualization.

See the *Example.jpg* at the root for an example website. 

### Version
0.1 

### Development
Currently, I'm not actively developing this website. One feature I may add, if I find the time, is to have more flexible and richer data visualization.

### Setup/Personalize
To setup and personalize the website, change the following things
* Copy your android app's database from dropbox to the root folder with name: 'babydaybook.db'
* Replace the image at root/static/img/main.jpg
* Once you have MongoDB setup, you can run 'mongoengineSetup.py' to setup the database with initial checkup data.
* Change sample checkup data with your own both at 'mongoengineStup.py (line 16-20)' and 'BabyDayBook.py (line 23-51)'
* To use MongoDB, you want to uncomment code related to mongodb at 'BabyDayBook.py' and 'app.js'.

### Note
This is a very simple website with little or no error checking so it's only for the brave! 
Also, this is dependent to [Baby Daybook]'s data model. Things will break if it changes.

### Tech

Web technologies used: 
* [Flask] - python microframework backend
* [MongoEngine] - store checkups just because
* [SQLite] - read android app's database
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Google Charts] - visualize data just for fun
* [JQuery] - great utilities for JavaScript
* [Bootstrap] - Supercharged CSS
